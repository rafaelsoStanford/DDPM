### Diffusion Model Training

This repository contains code for training a diffusion model using the UNet architecture. The diffusion model is a generative model that learns to transform a noise vector into realistic samples by iteratively applying a series of steps.
The code includes the `Diffusion` class for handling diffusion operations and the `train` function for training the model.
